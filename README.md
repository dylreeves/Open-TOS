Open TOS

Introduction
I have worked in the IT side of terminal operators for around 10 years now and have found that there is a severe lack of options when it comes to operating systems to run said terminals. I thought it would be an interesting experiment to create such a system myself and open source it.

Business Case
While I am not creating this solution for profit or for any specific organisation I will document a brief business case based on my experience working on terminals in Africa. Most terminal operators I have come across in the developing world run predominantly manual systems, while this is fine when throughput is low, as the terminals get more and more busy it becomes impossible to operate such terminals on a paper based manual system. To further complicate this all the commercial software packages available on the market are both rather expensive especially if your terminal does not generate revenue in dollars, pounds or euros and I have found these systems to be a little behind with regards to being web based, mobile etc. So for smaller terminals the options are limited and I hope that I can create something to fill this gap.

Architecture
The architecture of the system will be a web based application where the entire application will be hosted either internally or in the cloud with access to the application via a web interface, a restful API and perhaps eventually mobile apps.

Technologies
The technologies I will be using to create the system are as follows. Note that this is all subject to change as the development continues.
Version Control - Github
Database - Postgres
Web server application - Django
